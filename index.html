                        We had a call this evening and you asked about the difference between a mobile application and a
                        web application. Mobile apps live and run on the device itself. Snapchat, Instagram, Google
                        Maps, and Facebook Messenger are some examples of popular mobile apps. Web apps, on the other
                        hand, are accessed via the internet browser and will adapt to whichever device you're viewing
                        them on.

                        I did some research on the effects of using a web development framework on website SEO. I found some useful information about how "lazy-loading" affects SEO web crawling. Here's what I found.
                        Search engines can't crawl "lazy-loaded" pages so the information that is lazy-loaded does not get indexed for SEO. 
                        Site loading time is a major factor in SEO, and frameworks require external calls to APIs to fetch the JavaScript to accomplish framework-defined functions, which takes time, versus if the functions are defined in your site files (like when you use vanilla JS), there isn't a server-call delay, making the site faster.
                        <br>

                        I also worked on building the philosophy behind a framework that will allow easy website edits in the future.

                        I did some research to further understand the effect of using the same domain for multiple iterations of one website and/or using the same domain for a re-vamped and better-optimized website, and I found some useful information confirming that the final version of this website will not be impaired due to its history. The history of a website affects search ranking, but any website can reasonably overcome negative history so long as there aren't major negative items, a long negative history, or manual action against the website (i.e. the website broke the law or disobeys Google's policies).

                        We discussed component formatting and front-end tools and technologies. At this point, our decision to use Vanilla JS is finalized, along with SASS and HTML. Other practices for SEO will be implemented as well, such as configuring a secure HTTPS connection by default, using a high-speed and reliable hosting service for the website files, and using Semantic HTMl so the search engines can understand what the content is about and more effectively serve your website to users.

                            <li>*Server-side rendering is preferred for SEO because you don't have to rely on the user's device to construct the website; you can use the powerful devices on the hosting side.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>*Use of the shadow DOM (separate models of web objects embedded in each other) has no advantage for a simple project like this and sacrifices a small amount of speed, so we won't use this.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>*We can create our own virtual DOM (or model of the website) to determine what needs to be re-loaded to save processing power and increase website speed. Front-end frameworks provide this but add bloat and increase load times, so we will implement our own simple version based on your website's needs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        We implemented a homepage design that draws the user towards call-to-actions and presents the information in a way that each segment of user can easily find what they are looking for. We also discussed the implications of different methods of determining the site architecture in terms of user experience and came up with methods for doing this.

                        We discussed integer-ratio relationships for an aesthetic build and how to implement that into our development framework. It looks like it might take a few more days than expected. We did continuous work on UI and the development framework.

                        Today, we worked more on the UI and focused on finding the best way of making things mobile-responsive. We developed a component hierarchy that will be useful in the full build, as well as fleshed out some more details related to our development methodology and how to go about creating an extensible solution so that you can add modules later easily if desired.

                        A lot of what we are doing is building processes that will support the main build, and some of these processes must be in place for the single-page initial build -- i.e. we don't want to waste time implementing in a way that is different from the final build. The single-page application will likely take a few more days because of this overhead work we need to do to put the pipelines in place that will save time upon website modification or component augmentation.

                         Today, the framework for integrating aesthetic proportions of elements based on integer ratios was finished and is being applied to the site. The responsiveness is looking great, and we're making great progress on the single-page. Again, these tools we're creating will definitely apply to the main build and will save a lot of time later. We have to put in some legwork now but it will all be worth it because this application is going to be aesthetically amazing and great at segmenting users and giving them that great experience using your website. We also worked on gathering and creating written/visual content for the website. We are considering accessibility and SEO matters with every decision.
